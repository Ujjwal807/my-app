        adjustments as needed.

        Common Pitfalls: Avoiding Run-On Sentences and Ensuring Accurate Counts
      </h3>
      <p className="p-6 min-[320px]:px-4">
        One of the most common pitfalls when using an online sentence counter is
        the presence of run-on sentences. A run-on sentence occurs when two or
        more independent clauses are joined without proper punctuation or
        conjunctions, resulting in an inaccurate sentence count.
      </p>
      <p className="p-6 min-[320px]:px-4">
        To avoid this issue, follow these tips:
      </p>
      <ol type="1" className="py-4 px-8 min-[320px]:px-4">
        <li className="mt-2">
          Use proper punctuation, such as periods, commas, and semicolons, to
          separate independent clauses.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
          Break up long, complex sentences into shorter, more manageable ones.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-2">
          Use the online sentence counter to identify potential run-on sentences
          and make necessary corrections.
